# YouTube Homepage Clone

This project is a clone of the YouTube homepage, built to showcase my abilities in React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Features

This clone of the YouTube homepage focuses on the front-end design and includes the following features:

- **Video Grid Layout**: Replicated the grid layout for video thumbnails, titles, and channel information.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes from mobile devices to desktops.
- **Hover Play Effect**: Implemented a feature where videos play on hover, mimicking YouTube's preview functionality.
- **Navigation Bar**: A top navigation bar that mirrors YouTube's design, including the search bar and icons.
- **Sidebar Menu**: A collapsible sidebar with menu options, following the style of the actual YouTube sidebar.

Please note that this project is a front-end mockup; it does not interact with a real backend or YouTube's API, so the displayed data is static and the functionalities like search, authentication, or video playback are not implemented.
